  ðŸ“‡ Task 3: Simple Contact Management System

This is my third task for the Prodigy Infotech internship. I built a menu-driven Contact Management System using Python that allows users to add, view, edit, and delete contacts, with persistent storage using a local file.

## ðŸ’» What I Built

- A terminal-based program with a clean text menu
- Users can:
  - Add new contacts (name, phone, email)
  - View all saved contacts
  - Edit existing contact details
  - Delete any contact
- Contacts are saved to a `.txt` file so they persist after closing the program

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- Using functions to organize code logically  
- Handling user inputs and performing validations  
- Reading from and writing to files using Python  
- Structuring a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system  

Big thanks to **Prodigy Infotech** for giving me this opportunity to grow through real-world Python projects!
